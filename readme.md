# Tidal clock

The tides on the Pacific Coast of the US are harmonic and as such are not independently predictable.  The [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminstration](https://www.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/tide_predictions.html) provides access to tidal data at specific stations along the West Coast.

This project is a rendering of that data in an easy to consume format.  The long term plan for the project is to combine with a Rasberry Pi and screen and have it as a clock visible for easy access to current tidal information.

Here are a set of [setup steps](https://github.com/speedyjeff/tides/blob/master/setup.md) for how the project was put together.
